# Whiskars: When Atmosphere Carries the Night

*A whiskey bar that nails the look and feel, even when the drinks don’t always follow suit*

Some bars succeed by perfecting every detail. Others win you over with sheer charm, despite the occasional wobble. Whiskars falls firmly into the latter category—a place that creates such an appealing atmosphere that you find yourself forgiving its inconsistencies.

Tucked into a shared building on Sukhumvit 23, this whiskey and cigar bar has built quite a following across Bangkok. Walk in, and you’ll immediately understand why. The deep red lighting and black leather seating create exactly what you’d expect from a classic whiskey bar—warm, inviting, and designed for settling in with a proper drink.

## The Space and Its Personalities

Whiskars has two distinct moods, and timing determines which one you’ll encounter. Visit during a quieter evening, and you get the full experience—intimate lighting, comfortable conversations, and enough space to actually appreciate the classic bar atmosphere they’ve created.

When the place fills up, though, it becomes an entirely different beast. The same cozy space that feels perfect with a moderate crowd turns into something resembling a very stylish sardine can. Add the cigar smoke that comes with the territory, and you might find yourself planning a shorter evening than originally intended.

The live music strikes the right balance—present enough to add atmosphere, restrained enough that you don’t have to shout your order. It’s one of those details that shows they understand what makes a bar work for actual conversation rather than just Instagram photos.

## Cocktails: A Game of Chance

Here’s where things get interesting: the quality of your drinks depends largely on which bartender happens to be working your side of the bar. It’s like a cocktail lottery—sometimes you win, sometimes you wonder if you should have just ordered beer.

When you get the right person, the drinks justify the experience. The Old Fashioned arrives with a burnt orange peel that adds genuine smokiness, and their “Whiskars Sour” uses Monkey Shoulder and Berlangino to create something that improves on the standard template. The signature “Socialite”—white rabbit vodka, Campari, lime, tonic, and orange peel—can be genuinely refreshing when made with care.

Their Boulevardier and Negroni show real potential when prepared by someone who understands balance. Even the Daiquiri, though leaning sweeter than I prefer, demonstrates decent technique in the right hands.

But here’s the thing: cocktail quality can vary noticeably depending on who’s behind the bar. Some of the staff clearly understand classic cocktail fundamentals, while others seem to be working more from muscle memory than actual knowledge. At 400-500 THB per cocktail, this inconsistency becomes more noticeable than it would at your local corner bar.

The good news is that when you do get a skilled bartender, they seem genuinely enthusiastic about what they’re serving. The not-so-good news is that there’s no guarantee which version of the experience you’ll get on any given night.

## The Whiskey Situation

Whiskars positions itself around whiskey and cigars, and they deliver a solid selection that covers the bases without necessarily breaking new ground. You’ll find quality bottles and familiar favorites—the kind of selection that satisfies most people’s whiskey curiosity without sending serious collectors into raptures.

The staff knows their way around whiskey well enough to make reasonable recommendations based on your preferences. They’re enthusiastic about what they serve, which counts for something, even if their expertise feels more passionate amateur than seasoned professional.

For most visitors, their whiskey offerings provide plenty of options for exploration. If you’re specifically hunting for bottles you can’t find elsewhere, you might want to manage those expectations accordingly.

## Service That Tries

The team at Whiskars brings genuine enthusiasm to their work, which goes a long way toward making up for occasional technical shortcomings. They’re friendly and talkative when you want conversation, and they clearly care about creating a good experience.

What works best is their authentic interest in what they’re serving. Ask about a whiskey or cocktail recommendation, and you’ll get thoughtful suggestions based on what you actually like rather than just pushing the most expensive options.

The service style matches the atmosphere—relaxed and conversational rather than formal or rushed. Even when execution isn’t perfect, the good intentions usually shine through.

## The Honest Assessment

Whiskars succeeds primarily on atmosphere and good intentions. It’s a place that looks and feels exactly like what you want from a whiskey bar, even if the drinks don’t always match the setting’s ambitions.

The key is approaching it with the right expectations. Come for the atmosphere, hope for great cocktails, and you’ll likely have a good time. Come expecting flawless execution every time, and you might leave disappointed.

When everything aligns—which happens often enough to keep the place busy—Whiskars delivers exactly what many people are looking for: a classic bar experience that feels authentic and welcoming. The atmosphere consistently delivers on its promise, even if the cocktails occasionally need a little patience.
