# Elevated Elegance Above Bangkok

Perched on the 30th floor of the prestigious Rosewood Bangkok, **Lennon's** offers one of the city's most sophisticated rooftop experiences. Named after the legendary John Lennon, this sky-high sanctuary combines impeccable cocktail craftsmanship with breathtaking panoramic views of Bangkok's glittering skyline.

## Our Rating

**Ambience:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)  
**Taste:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  
**Service:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  
**Overall:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

## The Experience

From the moment you step out of the elevator, Lennon's commands attention. The space strikes a perfect balance between intimate sophistication and dramatic grandeur. Floor-to-ceiling windows frame the sprawling metropolis below, while the interior design pays homage to both contemporary luxury and subtle nods to the bar's musical namesake.

### Ambience & Design

The bar's design philosophy centers around creating an atmosphere that feels both exclusive and welcoming. Rich materials like marble, brass, and leather create warmth against the backdrop of the city's twinkling lights. The lighting is expertly calibrated—bright enough to appreciate the craftsmanship of your cocktail, yet dim enough to maintain the romantic allure of evening drinks high above the city.

## The Cocktails

Lennon's cocktail program is where the venue truly shines. The menu reads like a love letter to both classic mixology and innovative techniques, with each drink telling its own story.

### Standout Cocktails

**The Imagine** - A gin-based cocktail that perfectly embodies the bar's ethos. Hendrick's gin is paired with elderflower, cucumber, and a hint of rose, creating a drink that's both refreshing and complex.

**Bangkok Sour** - A local twist on the classic whiskey sour, incorporating Thai ingredients like lemongrass and galangal. The balance of sweet, sour, and spice creates a cocktail that's uniquely Thai yet universally appealing.
