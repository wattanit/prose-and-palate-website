## The Story

When reclusive Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo finally decides to give her first interview in decades, she insists it be with Monique Grant, a struggling journalist at a failing magazine. Monique is baffled by this choice—she's never written about celebrities and has no connection to the legendary actress. But as Evelyn begins to tell her story, spanning seven decades and seven marriages, both women discover that their lives are more intertwined than either could have imagined.

## What Works Brilliantly

### Character Development
Reid's greatest achievement is Evelyn Hugo herself—a complex, flawed, and utterly compelling protagonist. Evelyn is neither purely sympathetic nor entirely unlikable; she's a woman who made difficult choices in impossible circumstances.

### Historical Detail
The novel's recreation of Hollywood's Golden Age feels authentic and immersive. Reid clearly did her research, weaving real historical events and figures into Evelyn's fictional narrative.

### LGBTQ+ Representation
One of the novel's greatest strengths is its portrayal of a same-sex relationship during an era when such love had to remain hidden. The relationship between Evelyn and Celia is tender, passionate, and heartbreaking.
