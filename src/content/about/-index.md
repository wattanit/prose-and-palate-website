*Honest takes on bars, spirits, and books worth your time*

Welcome to Prose & Palate—where we share thoughtful reviews on things we're passionate about: exceptional bars, quality spirits, and compelling books. We started with these three because they represent areas where we've developed strong opinions and enjoy exploring what makes experiences truly worthwhile.

## Our Approach

We focus on quality over quantity, giving each review proper attention rather than quick takes or surface-level coverage. Our approach is personal and subjective: we'll explain what we think and why, so you can decide whether our perspective aligns with yours.

We visit bars as regular customers, buy spirits with our own money, and read books because we want to—not because we have to. This independence shapes every review. We judge everything against the expectations set by its price point and positioning, so a great 200-baht cocktail gets the same attention as premium experiences.

Based in Bangkok, we have access to incredible diversity in bars and spirits, from local discoveries to international standards. This provides a rich landscape for honest evaluation across different price points and styles.

When we recommend something, it's because we genuinely believe it's worth your time and money. When something disappoints, we'll explain why—particularly when premium prices don't match the experience.

## Why Read This?

These are our personal opinions, shaped by our tastes and experiences. You might disagree with our conclusions, but you'll understand our reasoning. We're more interested in sharing authentic perspectives than trying to please everyone or maintain diplomatic neutrality.

If you're looking for thoughtful recommendations from people who care about quality experiences, this might be the right place for you.
