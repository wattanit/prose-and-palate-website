#### Subjective Nature
All reviews are subjective opinions based on personal experience. Your experience may differ. We encourage readers to consider multiple sources when making decisions.

#### Rating System
Our rating systems are specific to each category (bars, spirits, books) and reflect our assessment criteria. Ratings are opinions, not objective measurements.

### Termination

We reserve the right to deny access to our Service to users who violate these Terms or engage in harmful conduct, though as a static website, access restrictions are limited.

### Geographic Limitations

This Service is intended for users worldwide. The content and reviews are governed by Singapore law. You are responsible for compliance with your local laws regarding the consumption of alcoholic beverages and other content.

### Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of Singapore. Any disputes will be resolved through:
1. Good faith negotiation
2. If necessary, binding arbitration at a location mutually agreed upon by both parties, or in Singapore if no agreement can be reached
3. Courts of Singapore as a last resort

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
